\section{Abstract}

%\begin{itemize}
A low self-and-mutual inductance, zero net turn coil and its capacitive power supply have been fabricated and installed on the HBTEP Tokamak.  The coil is used to locally shape HBT-EP's normal circular cross section, up to and including the creation of a poloidal field null above the inboard midplane.  This will enable HBT-EPs first investigation of the effects of shaping on the MHD multimode spectrum.  Post installation tests have affirmatively proven the ability of the coil to impose a continuum of shaping, from circular to fully diverted. A description of the coil system, it's components, and qualifying tests are below.  Results of initial experiments with are also provided and compared with simulations.\\

%\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Fabrication}
\subsection{The Coil}
\begin{itemize}
\item The HBT-EP shaping coil provides up to 40kA-turns of current.  HBT-EP's usual I$_{\mbox{plasma}}$ is ~10-15kA
\item The coil consists of a single 1$/$0 welding wire, wound toroidally 8 times. It is located slightly above the high field side midplane.
\item The 8 loops are distributed into 3 bundles, consisting of 2, 4, and 2 windings.
\item The winding reverses direction twice, such that the central 4-loop bundle is carries current in to opposite direction from the flanking 2-loop bundles.\\

\end{center}
\item Zero-Net-Turns constrution keeps coil self and mutual inductance low, and the shaping of the plasma extremely localized to a few poloidal degrees from the location of the coil.
\item The coil's low inductance (42$\mu$H) and low resistance($<$50m$\Omega$) allow for the use of a low energy, low voltage power supply.
\subsection{The Power Supply}

\vspace{.25in}
\end{center}
\item The shaping fields are sustained by capacitive discharge, provided by a 900V, 7.5mF startup bank, and a 250V, 0.6F crowbar bank.  
\item The capacitors are fired in two-stages, the start bank providing a quick establishment (850$\mu$s) and the crowbar bank long sustainment (90$\%$ of max current after 6ms) of the shaping field.
\item The power supply provides up to 40kA-turns of shaping current with only 22kJ of energy thanks to impedance minimizing design.
\item The crowbar bank is soft-switched into the circuit passively using a high current rectifier, ensuring a smooth transition from start-up to steady-state regimes\\

\subsection{The Limiter}
\item HBT-EP has two poloidally complete Mirnov Coil Arrays (see Fig.'s 6 and 7 for location)
\item Diverted plasmas will release significant energy to the area near the x-point.
\item HBT-EP's existing limiters were designed for a circular plasma, they limit at the midplane and top/bottom of the plasma
\item Two divertors were installed near the poloidal arrays to shade the sensors from incoming plasma
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{strike_point_limiter_cropped.pdf}\\
\item The divertors are made of $1/4''$ 3-16 Stainless Steel and shield 45$\circ$ of poloidal angle, rising from the inboard midplane.
\end{center}
\end{itemize}
\section{Operation and Qualification}
\subsection{SPICE Simulations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pulse amplitude and shape are controlled by selecting voltages on each bank; allowing for slower startup, tracking of shaping current to plasma current and/or position, and degree of plasma shaping - up to and including a fully diverted discharge.
\item Voltages and capacitances selected in design phase via SPICE to allow a maximum shaping current of ~9kA/turn\\

\vspace{.25in}
\subsection{Post Construction}
\item Shaping current is monitored by means of a rogowski coil manufactured in-house.
\item Comparison of simulated pulse traces to actual operation shows higher current than expected.

\begin{center}

\end{center}
\item Design points of coil were 49$\mu$H, 22m$\Omega$. Inductance measured @ 42 $\mu$H, resistance is too low to measure, but 17-18m$\Omega$ can be inferred from pulse shape.
\item HBT-EP plasmas have been run diverted using ~70$\%$ of available current
\item Modeling of flux surfaces using filamentary currents suggests HBT-EP has been successfully run diverted.\\

\vspace{.25in}
\item Toroidal non-axisymmetries are present due to pre-existing diagnostics impeding the run.
\item The largest non-axisymmetry has been modeled and shown to have the effect of increasing the coupling of the coil to the plasma\\

\end{center}
%\item The plasma is still diverted, but will have a larger scrape-off layer than otherwise
%\item Plasmas being shaped are more susceptible to diversion, but shots have been taken with steady MR, that are not extreme outboard.
%\item Study of decay index last year showed that we should be able to develop a stable shot.
%\item Mode analysis is so far inconclusive, as the spectra of diverted shots do not seem significantly different from limited ones
%\item future work: develop a longer lived diverted discharge
%\item future work: increase the database of diverted plasmas
%\item future work: search the database for or develop an unshaped shot with similar parameters (MR,IP,q*) for a direct comparison to diverted discharges
%\item future work: work to understand, and if possible, mitigate the toroidal asymmetries in the coil
%\item plots to display:
%\item MR (and IP ?) trace for a 'hard crash' shaped shot
%\item comparison of simulation of bfields tree data at TA
%\item stripey plot of shaped q=3 shot: best of 81593-98 compared to stripey plot of unshaped q=3 shot
%\item BD dominant modes and spatial structures from shaped to unshaped

\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Control Coil Shaping}
\begin{itemize}

\item HBT-EP equipped with 40 saddle coils, mounted on 20 conductive shells. 
\item These coils apply pulsed, fixed helicity perturbations to investigate plasma multimode response $^{[2]}$\\

\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{control_shell}\\

\item Saddle coil pairs fired with opposite polarity create a discrete analog to the shaping coil.
\item Currents in the coils are $\frac{1}{200}$ of the shaping coil, but are 5 times closer to the plasma surface.
\item These coils could be used to correct toroidal assymmetries in the coil's shaping field.
\includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{cc_down_APS_12}\includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{cc_up_APS_12}
\item Active control of the saddle coils allows a much broader range of pulse shapes, many of which are impossible with a capacitive power supply.  
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item The shaping coil is easy to install and low cost but will allow access to an entirely different regime of MHD physics for HBT-EP.  
\item Low inductance construction ensures that it will not significantly alter the standard HBT-EP discharge in non-shaped plasmas
\item Saddle coilset has demonstrated MHD effects of low power quasi-axisymmetric shaping, is a much more flexible instrument than the shaping coil.  
\item The results of saddle coil shaping can inform and guide our research with the shaping coil, and provide interesting results in their own right.
\end{itemize}
