\chapter{The Shaping Coil}
\paragraph{} The shaping coil is a single continuous piece of 1/0 welding cable, run eight times toroidally between the inner ring of the toroidal field magnet cases and the vacuum vessel.  This ex-vessel coil is located slightly above the midplane, mainly due to space limitations.  Were complete freedom of placement to obtain, the coil would likely be placed nearer the midplane, as we have active (pre-programmed) control of the plasma's radial location, but vertical location control is only passively provided by eddies in the conducting vessel walls and shells.
\section{Error Fields} 
The construction of the coil out of a single conductor necessitated a large separation of the leads.  The twisted pair from the power supply rises from the laboratory basement, splits with one lead breaking into the lowest turn, and the other breaking out of the highest turn.  The top lead is therefore unshielded for roughly 8 inches.  There are two points at which the cable is bent back upon itself to begin a new bundle and reverse the direction of the current.  This occurs at the same toroidal location, which is itself the same location as the leads.  The current in the leads travels in the opposite direction from the current in the jumps between bundles.  The lead is thus lashed to the the interbundle connections to both reduce the error fields, and prevent the jXB forces on the cables from causing damage to the coil insulation.
