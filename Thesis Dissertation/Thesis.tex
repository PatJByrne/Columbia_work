This thesis represents the first study of MHD external kink modes in shaped plasmas using the high resolution High Beta Tokamak - Extended Pulse (HBT-EP) magnetic sensor set.  This work required construction of a high current, low impedance poloidal field coil, as well as high-current, low-voltage capacitive power supply, and current monitoring hardware and software.  This coil allows shaping of the plasma on the inboard side of the torus, above the midplane, to the point of transitioning the plasma from impingement on a material surface, to being limited by a magnetic x-point.  The construction and operation of the bank is described, with a full partslist appearing in an appendix.  Individual modes in plasmas are extracted from the entire signal using a technique known variously as singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, or biorthogonal decomposition.  Coherent fluctuations of up to three modes is observed using the BD without the need for an a priori choice of basis set.  Measurements of plasma modes are compared to the predictions of simulations involving the codes TokaMac, DCON, and VALEN.  Modes with toroidal wavenumbers n=1 and n=2 are observed across both circular and shaped plasmas.  As predicted by the codes we see a roughly similar poloidal mode spectrum in modes with the same toroidal number, with a pronounced change localized at the x-point.  HBT-EP's active control coil set was used to excite naturally occurring modes, and the response of each type of plasma is compared.  Further studies have looked into excitation of highly stable, low-n, low-m kink modes.  We see a response highly localized at the x-point in shaped plasmas, which has implications for transport control in advanced fusion tokamak configurations.
